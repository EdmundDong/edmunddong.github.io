Mostly CSS. Working to replace my [current site](https://eedong.dev) since it needs some work.
## Todo:
- [ ] idk, something, prolly
- [ ] Fix main.css, it's a mess
- [ ] Get feedback on website
- [ ] Push website to bucket or something
## B64 Feedback:

- [ ] + Simple 
- [ ] - Too simple? 
- [ ] +/- I would have chosen a different font myself like Roberto. The font in the preview looks fine but the actual site is kind of eh
aCBu
- [ ] +/- Credit for background image could be smaller/nonexistent
- [ ] +/- and you could move the credit to the footer
- [ ] + If you can a little bit of scrollable stuff with a little personal blurb and photo would be good
    - [ ] + Maybe a small portfolio there too
    - [ ] + Also a menu maybe? CV/Projects/About me even if it's just links to subsections of the same page
I could do a mockup of the UX if you want
